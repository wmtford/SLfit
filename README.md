Calculation of next-to-leading order simplified likelihood coefficients
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SL backgrounds b_i for signal region i are parametrised as
```math
b_i = A_i + B_i*th_i + C_i/2 * th_i^2 ,$$
```
where the th_i are distributed as a multivariate normal.
